<h3>The Jungle</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>These vinyls were originally made for my Color Theory class. The original project brief was to make eight different CD covers with the same design but the colors had to be different. As inspiration we had to look up different patterns and then from there we had to come up with our own design. I mixed together a tropical theme and a bug theme. The top left is monochromatic, the bottom left is split-complementary, the bottom right is analogous, and the top right is any colors I wanted. When editing this project for my portfolio I realized something was missing, so I found a mockup and put my 2D designs on the vinyls to show what they would look like on an actual product.

<h3>JPT Mechanical</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>This logo was created when my friend asked me if I could make a logo for his dad's new company. He told me that his dad had absolutely no preference for what the logo had to look like, not even a preferred color. The only thing I had to go off was the name JPT Mechanical. So I went to work and this is the final result that they loved. He especially loved the wrench inside the P.

<h3>Surreal Magazine</h3>
<h4>InDesign</h4> 
<h5> This a magazine concept I had created. It is about an art magazine. The last page is a fake add I had to create for the project. There had to be one main story and one article.

<h3>Lux Health Brochure</h3>

<h3>Waldrobe</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>This project spanned the course of three weeks in one of my graphic design classes. First we had to make a logo of a fake company, but we had to use three different fonts and morph them into one. Then over the next two weeks we had to make a one page magazine ad, an email, and a mailer for our made up company. </h5>

<h3>Toys Over Time</h3>
<h4>Illustrator/InDesign</h4> 
<h5>This book was created in my sustainable systems class. The concept and design is created by me. The book was to help kids make sustainable toys using recycled materials. The book was divided by age range. 
</h5>

<h3>Frank Ocean Poster</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>This poster is inspired by one of his albums Channel Orange. I interpreted the word channel as a tv channel so I made the poster an old tv. I put the quote of one of his songs, “point the clicker at the tube,” at the top to go with the tv theme. I then put all of his songs on the speaker. I made the whole thing monochromatic to put emphasis on the color orange.

<h3>Manifesto poster/ Event Poster</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>This poster is based off the Yes Manifesto. The manifesto goes back and fourth, and constantly contradicts itself. That is why I made the colors vibrating. The background is not nessecarily meant to be read. The event information is what is made to stand out against the texture of the background.

<h3>Subway Scares </h3>
<h4>InDesign/Illustrator/Photoshop</h4> 
<h5>I created a series of posters that ironically inform the people about the crime in the New York City subways, while making it look like a vintage horror movie poster. All the subway images were taken by me.  </h5>
<img src="images/8.jpg">
<h3>Torres Logo</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>TI was asked by my friend Anthony to make him a logo for his small shoe restoration business. He was very unsure of what we wanted in the logo, so I figured I would draw up some examples for him. All he knew was that he wanted his initials in it somehow. The end result is the bottom logo. </h5>

<h3>Support Ukraine</h3>
<h4>InDesign and Photoshop</h4> 
<h5>The Ukrainian national flower is a sunflower. I made a series of posters that ultimatly show a field of dying sunflowers to symbolize the people of Ukraine that were tragically lost. </h5>
<img src="images/10.jpg">
<h3>Truck Wrap Designs</h3>
<h4>Photoshop and illustrator</h4> 
<h5>For the top design I was inspired by old stamps, which I covered the backside of the truck in. The side of that truck I put the company's information in stamp-like shapes to fit the theme. For the bottom I wanted the truck to look like a box since it is for a moving company. I put the “packaging label” on the back with the company's information on it. </h5>

<h3>Hungry Bark Billboard</h3>
<h4>Photoshop and illustrator</h4> 
<h5>
This is a project that I did in one of my classes. We had to pick between 10 different client briefs. I chose this one, and the description said the billboard must include a picture of the food, the saying “superfoods for super dogs,” the logo, and the website.

<h3>Bobby O's</h3>

<h3>Mantra Logo</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>This is on is my first projects at The New School. We were tasked with creating a logo of a mantra we like. I made this design because everyones reality is different, that is why "reality" is breaking through the box. The box symbolizes a person. I also tilted the letters to fit of shapping ones reality. </h5>
<img src="images/20.jpg">
<h3>My logo</h3>
<h4>Illustrator</h4> 
<h5>In my first ever graphic design class I was asked to make a logo that incorporates something about us as well as my name. I made tons of sketches, and came up with the idea of turning the G in my name, into a paint can. Since I love to paint I thought this would be perfect, and my professor wound up loving it. </h5>
